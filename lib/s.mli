      representing some pages which we have shared with [domid], either
      read-only [if not rw] or read-write [if rw]. The contents can
      either be:
      - `Zero: this means allocate fresh zeroed pages and use them.
      - `Buffer b : either share this buffer [b] directly (if the API
        exists on your current platform) or share a fresh buffer and
        copy the contents of [b] into it. To cope with both of these
        possibilities the application must use [buf_of_share] to access
        the true shared buffer. *)
